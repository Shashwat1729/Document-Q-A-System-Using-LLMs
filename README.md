# Document Q&A System Using LLMs

This project allows users to upload a document (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) and ask questions about the content. A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is used to extract answers from the document based on user queries.

## Features:
- Upload documents in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format.
- Ask questions about the content of the document.
- Get answers based on the content using an LLM (e.g., GPT-based models).

## Setup:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashwat1729/Document-QA-System-LLMs.git
   cd Document-QA-System-LLMs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to upload a document and ask questions.

## Example Use Case:
1. Upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT document.
2. Ask a question based on the document's content.
3. The system will provide an answer by analyzing the document's text.
